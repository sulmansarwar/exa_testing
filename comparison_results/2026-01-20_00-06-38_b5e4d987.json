2024\"\n**Source:** https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/updates-grounding-boeing-737-9-max-aircraft\n\n## 2. SOURCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe sources gathered are highly credible and include:\n- **Primary government sources**: NTSB accident reports, FAA official statements and orders, DOT Inspector General audits, Congressional investigation reports\n- **International aviation authorities**: Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau reports\n- **Established news organizations**: Seattle Times, New York Times, BBC, Reuters, AP News, CNN\n- **Aviation safety organizations**: Flight Safety Foundation, Aviation Week\n\nThe timeline is well-documented through official investigation findings rather than speculation. Multiple independent sources corroborate key events. The NTSB and FAA documents provide technical details, while news sources offer context and whistleblower accounts.\n\n## 3. GAPS OR CONTRADICTIONS\n\n**Gaps identified:**\n1. Limited publicly available detail on specific MCAS software changes between initial design and final certification\n2. Incomplete documentation of internal Boeing communications between engineering teams and management during 2015-2018\n3. The search results show a September 2025 publication date for some FAA pages, which appears to be a metadata error\u2014verification of most recent FAA statements needed\n4. Details about ongoing investigations into the January 2024 Alaska Airlines incident final findings not yet publicly released\n\n**Contradictions:**\n- No major contradictions found between sources. Timeline events are consistently reported across multiple independent investigations.\n\n## 4. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\n\n**For comprehensive research:**\n1. **Access full NTSB final reports** for Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes for complete technical analysis\n2. **Review complete Congressional testimony transcripts** from Boeing executives and FAA officials from 2019-2024 hearings\n3. **Obtain final NTSB report** on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 door plug incident (likely still in progress)\n4. **Examine Boeing's internal safety review documents** submitted to FAA during recertification process\n5. **Track ongoing FAA enforcement actions** and compliance requirements imposed on Boeing production facilities\n6. **Monitor current FAA Airworthiness Directives** for the 737 MAX fleet to understand continuing safety requirements\n7. **Review international aviation authority** (EASA, Transport Canada) parallel investigations and certification requirements\n\n**Note:** The pattern shows recurring themes of production quality control issues, regulatory oversight challenges, and the tension between commercial pressures and safety requirements spanning from initial development through current operations.

[INFERENCE - synthesis of timeline patterns]\n\n---\n\n## 2. SOURCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Mix of primary sources (FAA official statements, NTSB reports, official investigations)\n- Major news outlets (CNN, NPR, Seattle Times) with aviation expertise\n- Government oversight reports (DOT Inspector General, House of Representatives)\n- Technical aviation publications\n- Recent documents through January 2026\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Some reliance on Wikipedia for timeline synthesis (though cross-referenced with primary sources)\n- Boeing corporate statements may present company perspective\n- Limited access to complete investigative reports (some behind paywalls or redacted)\n- Ongoing litigation means some facts still disputed\n\n**Overall Assessment:** Sources are generally reliable with strong representation from regulatory bodies, independent safety investigators (NTSB), and credible journalism. The combination of official FAA statements, NTSB findings, and congressional investigations provides triangulated verification of key facts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. GAPS OR CONTRADICTIONS\n\n**Information Gaps:**\n- Limited detail on Boeing's internal decision-making process during 2016-2017 MCAS development\n- Incomplete information on specific FAA personnel decisions during initial certification\n- Door plug incident documentation gaps - Boeing has no record of who removed/reinstalled the door plug\n- Current status of MAX 7 certification (mentioned as ongoing but no firm timeline)\n- Details of Boeing's submitted 90-day action plan response to FAA (mentioned but not fully disclosed)\n\n**Contradictions:**\n- NTSB disputed Ethiopian report's finding about lack of MCAS documentation, noting Boeing provided information to operators four months before the Ethiopian crash\n- Boeing disputed NTSB chair's testimony that they hadn't provided employee names, claiming they had provided door specialists' names early in investigation\n- Conflicting data initially about similarities between crashes led to FAA's delayed grounding decision\n\n**Timeline Uncertainties:**\n- Exact dates of internal Boeing communications and warnings unclear\n- Precise timeline of when Boeing engineers knew about MCAS issues versus when management acted\n- MAX 10 certification timeline remains uncertain (pushed from 2025 to potentially 2026 or 2027)\n\n---\n\n## 4. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\n\n**For Deeper Investigation:**\n\n1. **Internal Boeing Documents:** Obtain full releases of Boeing employee communications and engineering reports from 2016-2018 through FOIA or litigation discovery.\n\n2. **FAA Certification Process:** Research FAA's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program evolution and how delegation to Boeing changed over time.\n\n3. **International Regulatory Response:** Compare how EASA, Transport Canada, and other regulators handled MAX certification versus FAA approach.\n\n4. **Pilot Training Requirements:** Investigate what specific simulator training changes were implemented and whether they addressed NTSB concerns.\n\n5. **Manufacturing Quality Control:** Examine Spirit AeroSystems' role in both the original MCAS issues and 2024 door plug incident.\n\n6. **Current Safety Culture:** Research Boeing's Safety Management System (SMS) implementation and independent expert panel findings on corporate culture.\n\n7. **MAX 7/MAX 10 Status:** Track ongoing certification efforts and any exemption requests for newer variants.\n\n8. **Economic Impact Analysis:** Investigate financial consequences on airlines, Boeing's order book, and competitive impact from Airbus.\n\n9. **Congressional Oversight:** Review complete House and Senate investigation reports for additional findings not summarized in public statements.\n\n10. **Whistleblower Accounts:** Seek additional testimony from current/former Boeing employees about ongoing safety concerns.",
