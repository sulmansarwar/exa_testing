### 💡 Building Your Value Proposition

This tool helps you **generate data-driven insights** for positioning Exa's semantic search.

**How to use it:**
1. Run comparisons across different query types (Scientific, Legal, Follow-the-Money, etc.)
2. Build up your comparison history (10-20 queries minimum)
3. Analyze patterns: Where does Exa+Claude excel? Where does it struggle?
4. Use the CSV export for pivot tables and deeper analysis

**What to look for:**
- Which query categories show higher Tier A% for Exa?
- Which types have better traceability with Exa?
- Where does domain filtering matter vs recency?

Your **Comparison History** becomes your proof - show stakeholders real data, not assumptions.
